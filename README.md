# BusTS
Transmission system for bus data. Made using Python. <br>

## How does this work.
BusTS sends JSON data over 915mhz (for the moment) of bus data - position, type of bus, id, route etc. <br><br>

## Installation
1. Clone this repo: ```git clone https://github.com/ar-cyber/BusTS```
2. Install required modules: ```pip install -r requirements```
3. Run the script to VIEW current data (only sent through internet for the moment): ```python3 recv.py```

## AS THIS IS A RADIO SIGNAL AND SOME COUNTRIES BLOCK IT, I AM NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE THE TRANSMISSION CODE. The transmission code runs on the radio signal and not the internet.
